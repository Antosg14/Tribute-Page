            Should've stayed, were there signs, I ignored?
            Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore?
            We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
            There are things that we can have, but can't keep
            If they say
            Who cares if one more light goes out?
            In a sky of a million stars
            It flickers, flickers
            Who cares when someone's time runs out?
            If a moment is all we are
            We're quicker, quicker
            Who cares if one more light goes out?
            Well I do
            The reminders pull the floor from your feet
            In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh
            And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
            Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it, isn't there
            If they say
            Who cares if one more light goes out?
            In a sky of a million stars
            It flickers, flickers
            Who cares when someone's time runs out?
            If a moment is all we are
            We're quicker, quicker
            Who cares if one more light goes out?
            Well I do
            Who cares if one more light goes out?
            In a sky of a million stars
            It flickers, flickers
            Who cares when someone's time runs out?
            If a moment is all we are
            We're quicker, quicker
            Who cares if one more light goes out?
            Well I do
